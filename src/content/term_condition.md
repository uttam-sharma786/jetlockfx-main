**Effective Date:** June 1, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

JetLock FX is a platform designed to help users compare currency exchange rates offered by local exchange bureaus. During our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase, we do not process financial transactions or hold user funds. JetLock FX acts solely as an informational and reservation marketplace.

## 2. Use of the Platform

By using JetLock FX, you agree to:

- Use the service only for personal, non-commercial purposes.
- Provide accurate and complete information when signing up.
- Refrain from misusing or interfering with the platform.

## 3. Lock Rate Feature

JetLock FX enables users to reserve a posted exchange rate from a listed bureau for a limited time. This reservation does not guarantee service availability and is subject to:

- The bureau honoring the rate at their discretion.
- The user arriving within the stated time window.
- No fees collected by JetLock FX for this service.

## 4. Bureau Listings

Exchange bureaus listed on JetLock FX are independent businesses. We do not verify licensing, legality, or compliance of individual bureaus at this stage. All transactions occur outside the platform, directly between users and bureaus.

## 5. Data & Privacy

We collect minimal data for operational use, such as:

- Email and location (for registration and currency comparison).
- Basic analytics (for product improvement).

We will never sell your personal data. For more, see our [Privacy Policy].

## 7. Pilot Program Terms

Bureaus joining the free listing pilot agree to:

- Provide accurate rate information.
- Respond to user reservations in good faith.
- Use JetLock FX for visibility only, not for direct payments.

## 8. Modifications

These terms may be updated periodically as the platform evolves. We recommend reviewing them regularly during the MVP pilot period.
